     	<div><h2>Side Step</h2><h3>2 sets, 20 steps (in each direction)</h3><img src="ladies-1.jpg"><div class="text1">Place a resistance band around your knees for this first exercise. As you move, you'll be in about a half squat with your spine neutral—neither rounded nor arched. Keeping your chest up, take small steps side to side. Focus on maintaining tension in your glutes.</div></div>
     	<p></p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>


     	<div><h2>Hamstring Curl</h2><h3>4 sets, 8-10 reps</h3><img src="ladies-2.jpg"><div class="text2">Start your first set using a heavy weight, then taper off for your next 3 sets. Do more work on the mind-muscle connection by paying close attention to your hamstrings as you slowly lower the weight. More time under tension leads to more gains! Updike says that if one of your goals is to build muscle size, make the last set a dropset: Do all the reps you can just short of failure, then drop some of the weight and rep to just short of failure again.</div></div>

        <div><h2>Box Step-Up</h2><img src="ladies-3.jpg"><div class="text3">This is a great exercise to do near the end of a workout, to really burn out those leg muscles. But leave a little in the tank—you're not done yet!</div></div>
           
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>



        <div><h2>Calf Press</h2><img src="ladies-4.jpg"><div class="text4">Start with your feet about shoulder-width apart and your toes pointing forward. As you work through the reps, experiment with pointing your toes in and out to see how each position hits a different part of your calves. This is one of Updike's favorite exercises because she finds that many women are so focused on working their booty-building glutes that they forget to work their calves. The calf press is a good way to help maintain a balanced look in your legs.
        <p></p>
        If your goal is to maintain overall balance, Updike recommends you do this workout once a week. If you want to focus on developing the shape of your lower body, do the workout twice a week!</div>
